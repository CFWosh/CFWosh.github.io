#### Aim and Scope
The design of embedded and cyber-physical systems imposes challenging and conflicting constraints and requires a holistic design approach. Implementing real-time high-performance systems and minimizing their power consumption at the same time is not straightforward. Emerging computing paradigms based on machine learning, brain-inspired computing and onboard data analytics impose workloads many orders of magnitude more challenging. At the same time, real-world unpredictable behaviour requires these systems to adapt at runtime to mutable conditions. Therefore, advanced modelling strategies as well as efficient design automation techniques should be capable of optimizing complex parallel applications over heterogeneous multi- and many-cores platforms. Complexity on algorithmic side and heterogeneity on hardware side are colliding system constraints, which can be tackled by adopting HW/SW co-design solutions and flexible design frameworks.

With respect to this context, contributions are expected in all the fields relevant to the design of embedded and cyber-physical systems:
 - low power embedded and cyber-physical systems
 - low power hardware and architectures for embedded signal processing and machine learning
 - HW/SW co-design and high-level synthesis techniques for low-power digital signal/image processing
 - design of energy-aware and autonomous systems
 - design space exploration techniques, with special emphasis on power/energy estimations and power minimization methodologies
 - parallel/high throughput processing techniques for low-power digital signal/image processing
 - algorithm-level optimization, low-complexity algorithms and approximate computing for low power embedded systems
 - dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques, HW and SW dynamic power management

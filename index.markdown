# CF23-OSHW
## Workshop on Open-Source Hardware 

***Co-located with ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers 2020***
***May 9 - May 11, 2023 - Bologna, Italy***

We are excited to announce a new workshop on the topic of open-source hardware, to be held concurrently with Computing Frontiers 2023.

#### Aim and Scope
The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the fields of computer architecture, electrical engineering, and computer science to discuss and share their latest research and developments in open hardware and open-source hardware. We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Design/implementation of open-source processors, memory systems, and I/O devices
- Open-source CAD tools and methodologies for hardware design
- Open-source embedded systems and IoT devices
- Open-source PCB, FPGA, and ASIC design and fabrication
- Open-source firmware and software for embedded systems
- Open-source test and verification frameworks for hardware
- Open-source power and energy-efficient systems
- Hardware security and trust in open-source systems

Submissions should be in the form of an extended abstract (2 pages), formatted according to the double-column ACM conference format, accompanied by a link to a public repository (GitHub, etc.). Accepted abstracts will be included in the workshop proceedings and published in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of an accepted abstract is required to register for the whole Computing Frontiers 2023 conference.
